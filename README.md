# basicRestaurant
Basic restaurant app built in Node.js, express, AJAX and handlebars

This was created for a web development course at Oregon State University. It is the culmination of a few assignments in the course all grouped here in a public repository.  This is an example of my skills using basic JS and HTML/CSS. The primary backbone of the site is written using express. Some of the feature also make use of bootstrap and handlebars templating engines.
